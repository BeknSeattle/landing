        <p>This landing page project was not easy at first, but now I am starting to appreciate the new way of writing functions, refactoring and revisiting your old codes and updating them. Learning the difference between the for loop vs to for...of loop, understanding methods. All is fun in code.</p>

      <blockquote>I think I spend more time trying to debug this second project than re-designing its CSS. Who would have thought that making your site interactive using JavaScript will be this hard/fun?</blockquote>
      <article><p>I have never spent so much time in the console and terminal before. I appreciate Live-server installed in my terminal too. Regularly researching and learning from other developers helped me a lot. I learned so much that my head still hurts. Understanding how the DOM works is only half the battle. <a href="https://github.com/BeknSeattle">Heres my github repo.</a></p></article>

        <article class="item-1A"><p>I love how a simple HTML tag with the combination of CSS looks fantastic on screen. Learning Flexbox and CSS Grid is a good alternative to using Frameworks. I love the typography combined with smart legibility for web and modern accessibility techniques. Learning to code is hard but rewarding. Knowing that browsers listens to user's triggered events just made me love this job even more.</p></article>

      <blockquote>I choose this career because I love to sit long hours just to code and design. Loving every moment of learning and praising God for giving me wisdom to overcome every obstacles. All knowledge comes from him. And I glorify God for imparting me with it. This is for my Joygi.</blockquote>
      <article><p>At first, I always thought whatever design I spewed out from any browser looked so good till I learn the dos and the don'ts. The rules that you need to learn to make the design readable and understandable. Learning non-stop and evolving is key. It is always a game-changer in this field. The time spent in the console tab feels worthwhile is it not?</p>
