        <p>This landing page project was not easy. For a JavaScript beginner like me, it was fun when your code starts to make sense while your starting to learn. And why iterating using the for-of loop and the old var = 0 etc. etc. works too.</p>
        
        <p>Learning those other browsers may not as friendly as Chrome. Learning <code>scrollToView()</code> does not work on Safari since 2005? What?</p>

        <p>I have never spent so much time in the console before. Boy oh boy! Regularly clearing the browser's history helped a lot. Googling the error responses and learning from other developers how they solved particular bugs helped a lot too. I learned so much that my head still hurts. When I already answered a specific action or function. Understanding how it works logically is mind-blowing.</p>

          <p>I love what I am doing. I love how a simple HTML tag with the combination of CSS looks fantastic on screen. Learning how far Flexbox and CSS Grid evolved through the years that you don't need CSS Frameworks anymore. I love typography. The accessibility versus legibility. All the ins and outs that make a site responsive. Learning how people interacts and responds to your site's structure and learning to debug your code is hard but rewarding. Now that I have learned how different browsers listens to user's triggered events just made me love this job even more.</p>

      <article><p>At first, I always thought whatever design I spewed out from any browser looked so freakin awesome till I learn the dos and the don'ts. The rules that you need to learn to make your design readable, understandable and pleasing. Always learning non-stop and involve, evolve and be dynamic is a game-changer in this field or for any front-end web
      developer fo that matter. I love this job because I do it for the people I love. Loving what you do while putting food on the table makes all the time spent in the console tab worthwhile is it not? For my Joygi.</p>
