Udacity project for Front-End Web Developer course. A One page landing layout. This project's layout is different from the original. If you want to see the; 
[Original-Template] (https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019). For this project I utilized CSS Grids and Flexbox to style the CSS. Used JavaScript for user interaction. 

### Installing
```
Clone or download
```
### JavaScript coding style tests
```
elem.getBoundingClientRect()
```
In order for the above code to work in your HTML. To make sure that the 
```
<section></section>
```
information fits in your browser. Try to test it first on mobile via the Chromes Dev tools. If the content you wrote fits on mobile then the action will trigger when the section's children is in view. Then adjust the content via media queries for other sizes.
